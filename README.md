# msf-bot - The Manchester Speculative Fiction Discord bot
This is the code for a basic bot to help with a couple of tasks for the Manchester Speculative Fiction Discord group.

[Manchester Speculative Fiction](https://manchesterspeculativefiction.com) is a writing group in Manchester, UK.

Itâ€™s for people interested in writing all types of speculative fiction. For example: science fiction, fantasy, and supernatural horror.

This bot has three commands:

`/hello` sends a welcome message for new members with links to key information. 

`/prompt` sends a writing prompt idea. 

`/echo` sends back whatever text the user adds and is just for test purposes. 

If you want to use this code feel free, but be aware that it does not include the code for registration of the commands on Discord. The botis based heavily on https://github.com/pixegami/discord-bot-lambda but has been adapted for Azure, and you can find code for registering the commands there.
